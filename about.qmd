Hello, my name is Min Sothearith, and I am currently pursuing a master's degree at Kongju National University in South Korea, with a research focus on the uncertainties in global climate models.

Welcome to my blog! This platform serves as a space where I share data analysis and visualizations created using Python. My goal is to explore and present insights through visual storytelling. Please feel free to explore my work and connect with me through the links below.

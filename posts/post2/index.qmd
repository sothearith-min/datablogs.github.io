## **🌳 Why Do Forests Matter?**

Forests are more than just trees — they are essential ecosystems that:

 - **Store carbon**, helping combat climate change

 - **Regulate water cycles**, preventing floods and droughts

 - **Support biodiversity**, home to countless species

 - **Provide livelihoods**, especially for rural and Indigenous communities

Understanding where forests are growing or shrinking is crucial for tackling environmental challenges at both local and global scales.

## **🛰️ Why Map Forests?**

Mapping forest cover helps us:

 - Monitor deforestation and degradation

 - Assess the effectiveness of conservation policies

 - Identify hotspots of land-use change

 - Support sustainable land management

## **📍 Case Study: Cambodia**

Cambodia is an important example due to:

 - Its large tropical forest reserves

 - Ongoing threats from logging, agriculture, and infrastructure

 - The ecological and cultural value of its forest landscapes

## **🔍 What I Did**

Using satellite data and public sources, I mapped:

 - Forest cover density across Cambodia in 2023

 - Trends in forest cover change from 2015 to 2022

Data Source: [Open Development Cambodia](https://opendevelopmentcambodia.net/)

## **🗺️ Forest Cover in 2023**

![](Post1_Enviroviz.jpeg)


The map (left) shows how forest density varies across Cambodia:

 - Dark green = dense forest

 - White/light areas = sparse or no forest

The graph (right) shows the decline in national forest cover from **43.1% **in 2015 to under **40%** by **2021**, with a slight increase in 2022.

## **📊 Key Insights**

 - Forest cover in Cambodia has steadily declined over the past decade

 - Protected areas in the southwest remain most intact

 - 2022 saw a slight increase — possibly linked to reforestation or improved monitoring

## **📚 What’s Next?**

To better protect Cambodia’s forests, future analysis should:

 - Identify deforestation hotspots

 - Track changes in protected areas

 - Link land cover trends to policy and development activity
